## Git Workflow:

We encourage contributors to follow a git rebase workflow. This workflow provides several benefits, including:

1. **Clean commit history**: Rebasing keeps the commit history linear and easy to understand.
   
2. **Prevents conflicts**: Rebasing helps avoid merge conflicts that can occur when merging branches.
   
3. **Easier integration**: Rebasing ensures your changes are integrated seamlessly with the latest upstream changes.
